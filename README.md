## 👋 Hi, I'm **Nidhal**  
### 💻 Software Developer | 🌐 Web Builder | ⚙️ Automation Enthusiast

I'm a software developer passionate about creating **impactful digital experiences** that live on the internet.  

My journey into web development began in **2016**, when I built my first website to showcase a piece of trading software I developed — a project that sparked a long-lasting fascination with **technology, problem-solving, and design**.  

Since then, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with **diverse clients around the world**, continuously expanding my expertise and embracing new tools, frameworks, and workflows.  

Today, my primary focus is on building **meaningful, user-centric solutions** that make a real difference — whether it's through automation, modern web apps, or full-scale digital platforms.
